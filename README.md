# NN's_For_Disaster_Tweets

This repo has all the code used during an Intro to Machine Learning course that ended in a final project. I chose to do mine on identificaiton of tweets containing 
information that would be dangerous. An example being that the neural network used for the model could delineate between a tweet saying, "the sky looks like it's on fire 
tonight" and another tweet saying, "my neighborhood is on fire and we need help." The goal is to build a tool that first responders could use to identify where 
they might be needed most during a crisis.
